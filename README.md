# Heroes of the Cubicles

This is a multiplayer LAN-based ASCII fighting game written in Python. [Click here to download the latest HotC Windows client!](/HotC_client_v0.1.zip) After downloading, right click the zip file and select `Extract All`. Run the program `HotC_client.exe` to start the game, use `HotC_client.exe --server <ip>` for a custom server IP. I made this game to kill productivity at work (joking of course). **It should only be run on an internal network!** There is no encryption used for game communication, password storage, etc. This repo mostly serves as a backup and likely won't be updated often. I take absolutely zero credit for any of the ASCII artwork, I found most of it on Christopher Johnson's [ASCII art website](http://www.chris.com/ascii/).

Features 4 playable characters! Who will you pick to dominate the cubicles?
