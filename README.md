# Heroes of the Cubicles

This is a multiplayer LAN-based ASCII fighting game written in Python 2.7 that I made to kill productivity at work. **It should only be run on an internal network!** There is no encryption used for game communication, password storage, etc. Also, I take absolutely zero credit for any of the ASCII artwork, I found most of it on Christopher Johnson's [ASCII art website](http://www.chris.com/ascii/).

Features 4 playable characters! Who will you pick to dominate the cubicles?
